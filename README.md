# MySQL Database Visualizations


# Introduction
This repository is based on pulling data from a MySQL database. This was created to display my ability to make visualizations from this type of dataset.


# Abstract
Have you ever wonder if it is possible to pull data from a MySQL database? Do you think it is possible to pull data from a remote database? These questions were the one that I aksed myself. I wanted to pull data from a remote MySQL database and create visualizations from it.


# Summary of Skills
I used the python environment to perform my actions needed to complete this repository. I also used the Pandas, Matplotlib, Mysqldb, and Sqlalchemy packages for this project.

# Findings
The dataset was located on a remote MySQL Database that I was tasked to pull data from this database and create data visulizations. This repository demonstrates my ability in dealing with this type of dataset. Retrieving data from a database is becoming the normal way of pulling data and this will help in displaying how I dealt with this task.


# Challenges
On this project, I ran into a few challenges. The first challenge was establishing a connection with the remote MySQL database. I did my research and I found a wonderful solution from the stackoverflow forums. The second challenge was to find a way of using the SQL language in the Jupyter Notebook platform. It was a little tricky for me to get it to work in this platform. These two challenges were not very big, but they were noteworthy for this project. 


# Conclusion
When I took on this project, I haven't pulled data from a database since my graduate school days. This project gave me many questions on the best way of pulling data from a database. With the help from different sources like the stackoverflow forums, I was able to find different paths to completing this project. I was a little cautious at the beginning of this project, but I knew that I would benefit greatly from this project. As you look through the notebook, you will see that there are many opportunities to expand the visualizations.
